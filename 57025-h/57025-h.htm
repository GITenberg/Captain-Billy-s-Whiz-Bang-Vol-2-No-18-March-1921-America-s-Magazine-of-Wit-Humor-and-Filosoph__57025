<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">At the close of the recent war, on my way home to
the Whiz Bang farm, still in uniform, I chanced
on an old sea captain friend of former days
down on New York’s Battery, old Jim Edmunds.</p>

<p>Later in the day, returning to my hotel with old
Jim in tow, I found an invitation to a formal dance
and card party awaiting me for that evening. I hit
upon the idea that it would be well to take Captain
Edmunds along; that his stories of the sea dogs would
prove entertaining to the guests.</p>

<p>Accordingly I persuaded Jim, after much difficulty,
to buy a dress suit for the occasion. The tailor couldn’t
convince Jim that the vest should be cut down, and
with only one button, but finally they compromised
on a two-button vest.</p>

<p>All went well until we arrived at the hostess’
home and I introduced Captain Edmunds to her. Jim
had on a medal he won for saving a ship at sea, and my
hostess, at first puzzled as to whether he was an ex-army
captain or a sea skipper, noticed the medal, and
exclaimed: “Captain, I see you’re naval.”</p>

<p>The old man blushed and blurted out: “Yes, and
if that danged tailor had his way, you could see a whole
lot more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The other evening I picked up my old neighbor,
Bob Jaeger, for a flivver spin to see the sights of
Minneapolis.</p>

<p>First of all we visited the National Dutch room to
enjoy the cabaret. Bob was much astounded as he
viewed the shapely dancers shimmying to the jazziest
of jazz orchestrations.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, Bob?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I think you’d better ask the orchestra to play
a wedding march, and play it quick,” he retorted.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Ignorance sometimes causes lots of trouble, and
sometimes it falls upon the innocent. Witness the
case of Gus, our hired man.</p>

<p>I went with Gus to the Shoe Palace in Robbinsdale
while he purchased a new pair of boots. Now Gus
suffers from a common malady—perspiration of the
feet—and he’s very sensitive about it.</p>

<p>The clerk sprinkled some French chalk into the
new shoes as he was about to try them on. Gus got up
angrily.</p>

<p>“If I can’t try on a pair of your boots without
having you sprinkle chloride of lime in them, I’ll take
my trade elsewhere,” he bellowed.</p>

<p>It was with much difficulty that I pacified Gus
and explained the use of the chalk. So now Gus has
a new pair of boots, and without the lime disinfectant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">A few days ago, for the first time in many
moons, I heard sweet strains of “Sweet Adeline”
coming in a rich soprano, with bass accompaniment,
from a passing automobile on the Whiz Bang
farm trail, and it brought me out of my reveries and
revived memories of bygone days.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the many times I had heard that
song along the trail from town, just after the bars of
Robbinsdale and Casey’s roadhouse would close, came
to me sweetly.</p>

<p>This brand of choral singing has become a lost art
under prohibition. “Sweet Adeline” as sung by a
troop of celebrators who wouldn’t know whether they
were standing on their feet or their heads, was very
beautiful.</p>

<p>To enjoy it thoroughly, one had to be quite drunk
himself. Jack would sing the tenor, Bob the bass and
I would join in the chorus, in sentimental strain. It
was all very touching. With it, nothing can compare.</p>

<p>In my memories I can still picture Jack’s tenor
squawking “You’re the flower of my heart” and Bob’s
bass refrain “Sweet Adeline,” after which came the
grand finale. Ah, those were the happy days.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>The couple that left an automobile seat at the
Whiz Bang farm a couple of months ago, while they
went to town to report the theft of their automobile,
haven’t come back yet, and I don’t know what the
deuce to do with the seat.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Many a man’s reputation depends on what isn’t
found out about him.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Women are divided into two classes; those who
desire husbands and those who desire single men.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>What has become of the old fashioned man who
used to be able to hit a bullseye on the spittoon at
thirty feet range?</p>

<p>Authorities have ruled that liquor can be placed
in mince pies legally. But if we had the liquor, we
wouldn’t wait for the pie.</p>

<p>A Minnesota man has a dog that chews tobacco
and still has some sense left. But it doesn’t drink the
liquor peddled these days.</p>

<p>The Smiths heard Liza Gander, their maid, in the
bathroom laughing and giggling for nearly an hour.</p>

knocking on the bathroom door.</p>

<p>“Lawsa me,” replied Liza between giggles. “Ize

<h3>Discounting a Discount</h3>

<p>A real estate agent was offered fifty dollars, less
two and a half percent discount for cash, for an option
on a piece of property. Being a poor mathematician
and wishing to conceal his ignorance of arithmetic
from his customer, he excused himself for a minute and
sought his new stenographer.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Brown,” he said in his
most expansive smile. “Delightful weather we’re
having, ain’t it? Now, tell me, if I were to give you
fifty dollars, less two and a half percent discount for
cash, how much would you take off?”</p>

<p>Instead of figuring it out, the young lady promptly
put on her hat and coat and went home, saying she
had been insulted. Darned if we can see what there
was to get insulted over. If she couldn’t figure it out,
why didn’t she say so and let it go at that.</p>

corn, wheat or something.”</p>

farmer.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the pencil pusher, “you might

a story for women in general. I do not believe the
public, outside of Los Angeles, realizes that the favorite
form for gaining a lady’s favor is to tell her
she ought to be in pictures.</i></p>

<p><i>Girls strange to Los Angeles fall hard for this style
of flattery, very often with serious final result. Designing
men quite frequently bunco the fair and trusting
creatures and “those who know” declare it is surprising
how the ladies like the movie flattery.</i></p>

<p><i>But here is the story, true to nature and only intended
for the eyes of the fair sex.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">BY RICHMOND.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Young women who desire to break into the
movies should be prepared to take a little
“breaking-in” themselves unless they indeed are
fortunate and bump into a man instead of some of the
rat horde that infests movieland. No line of business
in the world combines more petty jealousies than creep
through the Picture World. Men play the women
against one another; women play men and the whole
bunch forever conjure to hold the upper hand.</p>

<p>The following recital, by a clever French woman
who sought a place in Filmdom, is typical. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
woman was on the point of leaving for New York,
where she admitted that it would be necessary for her
to wear scant clothing in front of assembled multitudes
at the Winter Garden, but better she thought than
performing same for the benefit of sundry individuals
who pass the girls along according as new faces and
opportunity offer. The woman in question was French,
of superb figure and doubtful picture talent. She was
a fine dancer, also a singer. She told of being invited
to the home of a well known Hollywood character,
Prince Troubetskoy and wife, who recently departed
presumably for Europe.</p>

<p>Troubetskoy ranks as one of the greatest sculptors
in the world and his Hollywood home saw many a high
jinx, intrigue of love and gambling revel. The Prince,
a good natured old fellow, cared not what anyone else
did, so long as he could gamble and not be obliged to
eat meat. His wife enjoyed the society of young men,
though not many of them seemed to break their necks
courting her favor. The Princess didn’t get by very
well, not any too sweet with a little tea aboard. So
our lady of Film ambition meets a number of men who
lounge in and out partaking of the Troubetskoy hospitality.</p>

<p>Says the first:</p>

<p>“How comes it, Madam, with those eyes you are
not in Pictures. Surely there must be some mistake.
Now I am the leading man of the ⸺ ⸺ Company. I
am sure I could get you a chance if you would like to
try. But of course we must go out to talk it over; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
little dinner perhaps tomorrow night in my apartment
we—”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, what is there to be talked of?”
The Leading man seems to think the lady dull and
drifts away.</p>

<p>Then the second.</p>

<p>“Who—— that fellow told you he could get you a
part? Why he’s only the leading man. I am a director.
Leave it to me. Just you and I will go out for a little
dinner tomorrow night and talk things over—”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, the leading man also asked me
to go out with him to dinner, or come to his apartment
so the business could be settled—”</p>

<p>Still a third man.</p>

<p>“Did he say he was the director? I am the director.
He is only the assistant director. He has no
say. I will fix you up, you black eyed beauty. Tomorrow
night if you meet me, I’ll have a fine big car, so
warm inside. We will take a little trip, you and I,
oh, just to talk over some details, I—”</p>

<p>Madam speaks again.</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir, three times now tonight have
I been asked out to dinner to see what shall be done for
me to get a part. Does one always have to eat dinner
before getting into pictures?”</p>

<p>A fourth man.</p>

<p>“Piffle, I am manager of the entire company.
Those fellows haven’t a word to say about it; just bunking
you. Come with me to my little cabin up in laurel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
canyon tomorrow night. It is quiet and we will not be
disturbed while talking over the business. I—”</p>

<p>But still a fifth.</p>

<p>“Don’t let those men kid you. I have put up all
the capital. My father is a rich man in South America.
When it comes down to it, these fellows work for me
and, though I don’t interfere much, naturally I would
hate to see a girl that looks like you get left—”</p>

<p>The madam talks once more.</p>

<p>“I cannot go to dinner with you. I have been
asked by the four other men. I might take a chance
with the leading man because he’s half way young.
Though everyone says he doesn’t count, if I had to eat
dinner with someone I guess I’d pick out the youngest
and let you ‘burned outs’ try your luck somewhere
else. But I’m eating by myself tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>Two or three camera men and some publicity
agents possibly invited the lady out to dine, but the
ones she seemed to remember began with the leading
man and ended with the fellow who said he owned the
bankroll that kept the company on the map.</p>

<h2><i>Cherubim of Hell</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Reverend Morrill, the Whiz Bang’s fire-eating gospelite
writer, is now touring the West Indies for this
magazine. Remember the Martinique articles written
after his recent tour to that sinful island for the
Whiz Bang? His present trip presages some more
hot sermons. In the April issue, Reverend Morrill’s
story of Parisian life, “Midnight Madness,” will appear
in the Whiz Bang. Later, during the summer
months, he will deliver to our readers a carload of
dynamite. Watch for his explosion!</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL.</p>

<p class="center sans">Pastor of the People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Helen never raised more hell in Troy than the
island of St. Lucia did in the West Indies. It
is some 250 square miles, is volcanic, and has
been in constant war-like upheaval.</p>

<p>Our ship, the “Caraquet” has arrived here, where
for 150 years the French and English have cut each
others throats. From 1605, when English settlers
landed in the “Oliph Blossome” from Barbadoes and
were massacred in less than two months—others were
smoked out by natives burning red pepper—to 1814,
when the isle was finally ceded to Great Britain, St.
Lucia has been seeded with hate and borne a harvest
of death. In three years, from 1793 to 1796, England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lost 80,000 soldiers, including 40,000 dead. This topped
the loss of Wellington’s army from all causes during
the Peninsular war. Add to this yellow fever, malaria,
the deadly fer-de-lance snake, hurricanes, earthquakes,
bush-bandits and runaway slaves the revolution
set free (who kidnapped, ravished, maimed,
burned and robbed) and St. Lucia’s cup of gall and
gore is running over—as are the wasps, centipedes,
tarantulas, mosquitoes and scorpions over the people.</p>

<p>This was a Pandora’s, not a Christmas box. I wonder
that all the inhabitants are not like the mad woman
who rushed out of the insane asylum howling at us as
we entered Castries harbor. St. Lucia was a martyred
maid in the time of Diocletian, and lost her money and
her eyes. The island bearing her name has suffered
outrage and martyrdom and may well invoke her as the
patroness of the poor and blind, for its inhabitants are
afflicted with poverty and eye disease.</p>

<p>The land-locked harbor is the military key to the
West Indies. Morne and Vigie are striking fortifications,
and historic hill-tops in the back-ground have
been bathed in the blood of those climbing the Calvary
of death. They were drenched in mist and rain when
we docked. Coal and not carnage is the leading industry
now. Instead of shambles, all is soot. Ships come
for fuel, not to fight. As at Nagasaki, Jamaica, St.
Thomas and Martinique, women do the coaling. In
place of Kingley’s poem, “Men must work and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
must weep,” it is, “women must work and men must
sleep.”</p>

<p>The coal wenches are amazing Amazons. How
they wiggled and waltzed with coal-baskets on their
heads, sweating, swearing, singing snatches of French
songs and swaying to the music of a carnival band that
came down to the boat and acted like madcap strolling
players standing on heads and hands. The girls made
a few cents a basket; if one greedily ran ahead out of
turn, there was a “switchman” to lash her back in
line. What coal-black Caryatides! Wonderful models—not
of manners or morality—but muscles that would
give a sculptor fits. Sure Mike Angelo would have
wrestled with them, but Ben Cellini would have
thought twice before he dared throw them about as
he did his model whom he grabbed by the hair, kicked
and mauled so she was compelled to anoint her wounds
with bacon fat while he stood around and “larfed.”
These husky, dusky damsels would have brained him
with a lump of coal, thrown him in the sea, or mopped
up the island with him. This holiday work gave the
begrimed beauties extra money. They like work and
carry their burdens on, not in their heads, the baskets
often weighing 150 pounds each.</p>

<p>Streets of Castries are laid out in right angles,
and many of the population were laid out in the streets
at all angles. Every old soak fills up. I saw a black
man and woman stagger along the walk, fall in the
gutter, make love and wallow there like pigs. In the
outskirts darky women were dragging their drunk
lovers, brothers or husbands through the mud by heels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
or head or spreading them out like clothes to dry on
doorsteps or windowsills. The squalor was stentorious
and stercoraceous. Castries was a medley of noise,
music and mud. The only bible commandment followed
was the eleventh. “Thou shalt get stewed.” The
patron saint of the city must be Saint Amant, the
French seventeenth century bacchanalian bard who received
inspiration for his drinking songs by imbibing
enormous quantities of spirits which resulted in ebullitions
like “La Debauche.” Alcaeus said, “Wine and
truth”—and it was a very naked truth we saw in the
Casino on the hill. Yes, it was quite “orgiferous.”
What is an orgy? Listen to Gautier:</p>

<p>“Oh, the orgy giving to the winds its heaving
breasts, red with kisses; the orgy shaking out its perfumed
hair upon its bare shoulders, dancing, singing,
shouting, holding one hand out to this man and the
other to that one; the orgy, hot courtezan, that yields
readily to every fancy, that drinks punch and laughs,
that stains the cloth and its gown, that dips its garland
of flowers in a bath of Malmsey wine; the ribald orgy,
showing its foot and its leg, letting its heavy head fall
to right or left; the quarrelsome, blaspheming orgy,
quick to snatch its stilleto from its garter; the quivering
orgy, that has only to stretch out its wand and
turn an idiot into a poet and a poet into an idiot; the
orgy that duplicates our being, and sends fire running
through our veins, sets diamonds in our eyes and rubies
on our lips; the orgy, the only poetry that is possible
in these prosaic days.”</p>

<p>The Casino orchestra was squeaking, the couples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reeking; airs were lively like those of the girls. One
temptress asked me to give her a good time—and my
watch; another charmer wanted my gold charm; but
discretion was the better part of virtue and valor. To
escape with money and morals, we slid down hill after
throwing them a few shillings to buy religious tracts
to make tracks in a different direction. In town a
crowd stood watching two women fighting and shaking
their fists and naked breasts at each other till the sweet
milk of kindness turned to sour hate.</p>

<p>I went to a local banker to change some money. He
was not in his office or home, but his charming daughter
was. We exchanged Christmas courtesies and coin.
She said she disliked our high American exchange, the
color line in United States, and praised the fact that
blacks and whites in St. Lucia ate, slept and grew up
together. I was sorely tried, for a long time resisted
temptation, but eventually succumbed to the enticements
of this Eve’s daughter. She made me drink a
glass she had filled with old French rum, syrup, lime-juice
and other good things. I can’t remember, except
that it was eloquent of the time, place and occasion.
O tempora, O mores! How blessings brighten
as they take their flight. I write with a glass of water
nearby, in spite of the Horatian dictum that songs are
not able to live long or please that are written in
draughts of water. But I am writing prose, not poetry.</p>

<p>The guide-book asserts that “modest sleeping accommodations
can be found in this island.” If so,
it is one of the few places in the West Indies where,
by day and night, the traveler is offered sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
accommodations far removed from sleep or modesty.
Cricket is popular in Castries, but not the bed-bug and
cockroach.</p>

<p>If one is socially inclined there is many a black
beauty whose back steps “take hold on hell.” One
is accosted noon and night. Boat traffic in the West
Indies is not always legitimately commercial. At
different isles girls come aboard to sell beads, fruit
and themselves. A ship is often delayed in getting
these moral derelicts and strumpet stowaways put off.
Do not be surprised if at various ports, men board the
ship and invite Americans going ashore for the night
to come and stay with their sisters—a hospitality quite
Mexican and Latin-American. This is “old stuff” to
observing travelers, but not often referred to by the
average writers and lecturers on the West Indies who
profoundly inform you the sky is blue, the grass green
and the water wet. True, but Columbus discovered
that—is there nothing else to describe?</p>

<h3>A Dog Story</h3>

<p>Two dogs, on a trip through the Minnesota woods,
came upon a skunk.</p>

<p>After considerable discussion “Little Dog” was
chosen to engage the strange intruder at battle. When
he returned, “Big Dog” asked him how he had fared.</p>

<p>“Fairly well in the first round,” reported “Little
Dog,” “but in the second attack the son-of-a-gun
gassed me.”</p>

<h3>A Friendly Household</h3>

<div class="bold">

<p>“A flirt, am I?” exclaimed Mary Ann, under notice
to go. “Well, I knows them as flirts more than I do,
and with less excuse.” She shot a spiteful look at her
mistress, and added, “I’m better looking than you.
More handsome… ’Ow do I know? Your husband told
me so.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said her mistress frigidly.</p>

<p>“But I ain’t finished yet!” retorted Mary Ann. “I
can give a better kiss than you! Want to know who
told me that, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“If you mean to suggest that my husband—”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t your husband this time,” said
Mary Ann. “It was your chauffeur.”</p>

<p>He—“Oh, dearie, please give me just one.”</p>

<p>She—“I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s Lent.”</p>

<p>“Will you when you get it back?”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Another good drink has been scratched off our
list when we make our rounds of the bootleg joints—sherry
and egg, for with eggs at a dollar a dozen and
sherry 90 cents a finger, we can’t make the grade. However,
as McIntyre &amp; Heath might say, if we had some
sherry, we could have sherry and egg, if we had an egg.</p>

<h3>He Gets a Tip</h3>

<p>The dinner was excellent, and what made it better
still was the fact that the girl who waited at table
was one of the prettiest girls he had ever seen in his
life.</p>

<p>And now it was time for him to leave his host and
hostess and return to town. As luck would have it,
however, it was discovered, too late, that the last train
had gone. There was no alternative—he would have to
stay the night, but the difficulty was that the house was
full.</p>

<p>At last a bright idea seemed to strike the hostess.
“I hardly like to suggest it,” she said, “but would
you mind turning in with the cook?”</p>

<p>Knowing full well that they kept only the one
maid, whom he had already seen, he accepted the offer
with almost unseemly alacrity.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said the hostess, obviously
much relieved; “the bed will be quite large enough—you’ll
find him quite a superior man; indeed, he’s engaged
to our parlormaid.”</p>

<h3>Oh, Mommer, Boil My Socks</h3>

<p>We’ve heard a lot of boarding house jokes, but
the one our hired man, Gus, tells is the prize winner.</p>

<p>Gus was boarding in Chicago once where they had
no napkins. Whenever Gus wanted to wipe his fingers
he called the shaggy Newfoundland dog and rubbed
them in the dog’s hair. Saturday night the cook
washed the dog and Sunday morning they had soup.</p>

<p>After a little struggle in the moisture, Bill found
himself safely within the confines of an empty lifeboat.</p>

<p>Realizing that he was safe himself he began to look

<p>Observing several men endeavoring to keep afloat
nearby, he reached over the side and grabbed two of
them by the hair and dragged them into the boat.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bald-headed man appeared alongside
the boat. Peering over the side, Bill slapped him on the
head and cried angrily: “Gwan down and come up
right.”</p>

<h2><i>“Wimmin”</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By Jack Andrews.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The ever perplexing, never understanding, and
most ancient of mysteries—Woman—is still
with us. With but slight variations she is today
the same enigma as were her predecessors running
back to the beginning of time.</p>

<p>The modern man starts out just about as the cave
man did, only he believes he is more accomplished, and
capable of penetrating the veil that men of vast experience
in dealing with the “deadlier sex,” associate with
the Unknown Origin.</p>

<p>It is the incertitude of what Woman will do that
brings out the gambling spirit in all of us, makes wise
men of some of us, and pessimists of the rest of us.</p>

<p>When you find this type of pessimist, a man who
breaks out the hammer as the talk tends toward women—wild
and otherwise—just jot it down in your little
note book that at some time in his life a little bubble of
conceit was pierced by a woman, and a man failed to
measure up to the requirements.</p>

<p>There is another class of supposedly male beings
who continually rant about the women. They usually
exhibit a holier-than-thou attitude when the pleasures
of a woman’s society are mentioned, and denounce them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
as contributors to the undoing of man. They boast of
a virtue that stamps them as impotents, superinduced
by their own follies, and makes of them living hypocrites,
ashamed to acknowledge the truth.</p>

<p>A man who boasts of “never a thought of women”
will certainly not be molested by REAL women.</p>

<p>Remember this, my friends, that in the conquest
for a woman’s love, it is far better to be audacious, for
to profess too great a virtue may cause them to doubt
your virility.</p>

<h3>Embarrassing Moments</h3>

<p>A Robbinsdale school teacher had a class up to
spell. They were very young. She pronounced the
word “leg.” The young miss who was to spell it was
very modest and couldn’t spell it, a big awkward boy
blushed furiously when it was passed down to him and
the next one spelled it.</p>

<p>“And what is the definition?” she asked, elevating
her eyebrows encouragingly.</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

<p>“Why children,” she insisted, “surely you know
that? What is it of which I have two and a cow has
four?”</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause for just a moment
and then a diminutive urchin at the foot of the class
yelled out an answer. The answer has not yet appeared
in print, but they do say that there was a vacation the
rest of that day, while the teacher recovered consciousness.</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">During the past month, we have received an inquiry
from a reader asking us to define a
“lounge lizard.” We have nothing of that caliber
in this rural community of Robbinsdale. Most
of us are poor financially, but strong in the knowledge
of Mother Nature and the homely ways of the farm
and fireside. During the midst of our studies, we journeyed
through Shakespeare’s immortal “King Lear,”
and in the scene before Gloucester’s castle, we find
the following:</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Kent: Fellow, I know thee.</p>

<p>Oswald: What does thou know me for?</p>

<p>Kent: A knave, a rascal; and an eater of broken meats; a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred pound, filthy,
worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action taking knave, a glass-gazing,
super-serviceable, finical rogue. One that would’st be a bawd
in the way of good service, and are nothing but the mad composition
of a knave, beggar, coward, and the son and heir of a mongrel; one
whom I would beat into a clamoured whining if thou denyest the
least syllable of thy addition.</p>

</div>

<p>We have omitted some expressions from this denunciation.
We have deliberately weakened it. We
cannot find it in our soul possible to condemn any fellow
man in such language as Shakespeare uses. We
follow the quaint philosophy that every man has a redeeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
quality and that none combines the bald badness
which Kent ascribes to Oswald. In our community,
a man denounces another in few words. We
shake our fist and call our enemy “a blankey-blank-son-of-a-blank.”
Our language may not be as polished
as Shakespeare, but it seems to satisfy the vendor.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Wonder what a dog thinks about while he sits
hours at a time watching his master bending
over a battered desk pecking with two pitchfork-blistered
fingers at a typewriter model of 1898?</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to consider the dog? I’ll
admit that in the eight years my collie breed “Shep”
has been my faithful companion, I have never stopped
to give him thanks or to reason with myself why this
dumb beast should love me so.</p>

<p>As I work here by my old desk in Whiz Bang headquarters,
“Shep” sits on his hind quarters panting.
Occasionally, as I turn in a friendly glance, he points
his nose as if inviting an affectionate pat. “Shep”
seems to approve of my magazine. I really believe he
understands what it is. He seems never so happy or
affectionate as when he sits beside me in my study.
When I’m in the field he saunters about, paying little
attention to me, but here in the study he seems vitally
and keenly interested. His attitude brings me to Senator
Vest’s plea for a dog.</p>

<p>“The best friend a man can have in this world may
turn against him,” said the senator. “His son or daughter,
whom he has raised with kind and loving care, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
prove ungrateful, those who are nearest and dearest to
us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our
good name, may become traitors to our faith. The
money a man has, he may lose; it flies away from him
when he perhaps needs it most. A man’s reputation
may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action.
Those who are prone to fall on their knees and do us
honor when success is with us, may be the first to cast
the stone of malice when failure settles its clouds
upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend
a man can have in this selfish world, is his dog.</p>

<p>“A man’s dog stands by him, in health and in sickness,
in poverty and in wealth; he will sleep on the cold
ground, when the wintry winds blow and the snow
drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master’s
side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer
him; he will lick the wounds and the sores that come
from an encounter with the roughness of the world. He
guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a
prince.</p>

<p>“If fortune drives the master forth, an outcast into
the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog
asks no higher privilege than to accompany him, to
guard against dangers, to fight against his enemies.
And when the last scene of all takes place, and death
takes the master in its embrace, and his body is laid
away in the cold ground; no matter if all other friends
pursue their way, there by the graveside will be found
the faithful dog, his head between his paws, his eyes
open yet sad, in alert watchfulness. Ever faithful unto
death.”</p>

<div class="verse">And if you search down to the bottom, you will find man the cause of it all.</div>

<div class="verse">But he is led back in society and nursed with the tenderest care,</div>
<div class="verse">Held up to the world as a hero, and mentioned in fervent prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">While she is cast out from her loved ones; out in the hard, cruel world,</div>
<div class="verse">And everyone points out and scorns her, the poor little prodigal girl,</div>
<div class="verse">Now, as has been said quite often, and we will repeat it again,</div>

the usual ten spot,” he said. “Funny isn’t it? Here
I am making three times as much money as you, and
yet I have to borrow from you every week. You
always have money on hand, and I feel ashamed to ask
you for another loan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied Annie, “I haven’t
as much money as you think, but I have borrowed from
the boss and always manage to hoard a little bit.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you do!” exclaimed Sandy. “That’s

<p>A.—This blushing experience befell May
Allison recently while enacting the famous

“Do you know this is Sunday?”</p>

Fearing to bring down on their devoted heads the
wrath of their father by making a bother about it, she
asked them quietly if it were true, but could obtain no
satisfactory reply.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that by a little strategy she
might get the truth from one of the girls, so she said
in a jocular manner, “Now, Mary, I want you to answer
me candidly. Which of my two sons do you like going
out with best—George or William?”</p>

<p>“Well, ma’am,” replied the maid, reassured by
the lady’s manner, “if you must know, of the two I
like George the best; but for a downright good spree,
give me the master every time.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
